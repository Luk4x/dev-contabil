# Dev Contábil

## About
Dev Contábil was a project for an accounting site, built in the event "Missão Programação do Zero" with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript, by Rodolfo Mori. It was a simple and fun project to do, I really liked the result, and I also added some improvements like responsiveness and other small details.
